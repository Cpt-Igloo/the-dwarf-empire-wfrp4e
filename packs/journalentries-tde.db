Gather your armies if you can, for your head is mine to hew from its neck, just as your grandsire took my father's hand a century hence today!&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash; Thrundil Barrelbeard, settling an old debt</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The leaders of a Dwarf throng are its Lords and Thanes. These are the most powerful fighters in the army, fell-handed warriors equipped with the finest arms and armor of the clan&rsquo;s weapon hoard. As a rule, Dwarf Lords and Thanes are a grim sort, for they are the leaders of a dour people. Upon their broad shoulders is carried the weight of untold debt&mdash;the inherited grudges of a long-suffering and unforgiving race. It is their lot to avenge all wrongdoing to their clan, hold or race, not just in the present, but also for all time. Failure to redress an injury from antiquity is particularly galling, an act of disrespect to the much-revered ancestors.</p>\n<p>Lords and Thanes are well tutored in the ways of their ancient foes and must absorb a wealth of wisdom. Luckily, they are privy to the councils of clan elders, as well as venerable Runesmiths and Engineers. This sagacity is vital, for by the time their beards have grown long enough to lead, Dwarf Lords and Thanes must master tactics and manoeuvre, learning to wield the armored might of their throng as well as they wield an axe and shield.</p>\n<p>For a Thane to progress to become a Lord, he must bear royal blood. If a king dies, a Lord may rise in succession, or a new kingship may be claimed if the clan re-takes an old hold or establishes a new one. All leaders swear oaths of loyalty to a major Dwarf stronghold, which in turn, is sworn to the High King of Karaz-a-Karak. The High King nominally commands all kings, but in practice, this is more a matter of cooperation than of strict abeyance, as Dwarfs are proud individuals who rile at the idea of blind obedience.</p>\n<p>All Dwarfs take great pride in their possessions, but none more so than the ruling class. Depending upon wealth or clan, a Dwarf Lord or Thane might be equipped with runic weapons and armor. It is an honor for a Dwarf to bear such relics of war, for each item is passed down from their forefathers, an ancient legacy in its own right. Covered in runes and bristling with arcane might, each of the hold&rsquo;s relics has a long history of great deeds and feats of battle.</p>\n<p>While Dwarfs are notably an infantry force, there are a few exceptions among their leaders. Some Lords are carried into battle by Shieldbearers &mdash; stout warriors who heft a shield to serve their liege as a fighting platform. This was common amongst Dwarfs of the southern holds and has been continued elsewhere, notably by King Alrik Ranulfsson of Karak Hirn. In other clans, especially northern ones, Lords and Thanes prefer to fight atop Oath Stones, rocks upon which runes are struck &mdash; listing out the clan&rsquo;s honor, or perhaps the Lord&rsquo;s lineage or deeds. The stone is a symbol of their homeland, a piece of their stronghold made manifest.&rdquo;&nbsp;<strong>- Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species: </strong>Dwarf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Courtier</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Thane Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;

Highly prestigious individuals, these Longbeards garner great respect within a Dwarf stronghold, and are often chosen to be the leaders and advisers of many domestic issues and military campaigns.</em></p>\n<p><em>Only a Dwarf who has reached the age of five-hundred or has a beard that is touching the very floor will he be readily considered a Longbeard. This ensures that they receive the proper respect from other Dwarfs, who have been taught at an early age, and quite rightly so, to always respect their elders and listen to their well-earned wisdom.</em></p>\n<p><em>Indeed, for it is true that the Longbeards have fought in more wars, beaten more foes, and endured greater hardships than any young Dwarf could possibly imagine. They constantly grumble about how today's Goblins are far smaller and weaker than they used to be, and how nothing is as well made as it was in their day. No young Dwarf would dare argue with them, for they indeed have the experience and the beard to prove it.</em></p>\n<p><em>Should the Kingdom of the Dwarfs come under siege by their most hated of enemies, the Longbeards would be one of the first to take command. Equipped with some of the most well-crafted Dwarfen armor and weapons within their Clan, these Longbeards muster into their own regiment of crack heavy infantry, forming an unbreakable wall of shield and muscle that few can ever hope to crack. In battle, Longbeards are able to demonstrate their time-won skills, showing little regard for even the smallest shifts in fortune that would throw less experienced warriors into confusion, and enduring punishments that could break the mighty resolve of even a Dwarf.</em></p>\n<p><em>Such is their inspiring presence on the battlefield that the Longbeards provide the army a reliable anchor which holds the rest of the army together.

Due to their many years of experience, they start with substantially more XP over a standard Dwarf for any career&mdash;the older the Dwarf, the tougher, stronger and wiser they are. The Age Table provided gives the player a chance to roll a higher amount of starting XP and Resilience, and the Heirlooms Table grants the Dwarf a selection of special starting trappings.</p>\n<p>Roll a d10 on the age table then roll for the amount listed. If the player rolls an age between 200-500 years old, then they may roll on the Heirlooms Table with a d100 for a unique starting trapping passed down to them by their ancestors, but not on the Bonus XP Table. If the player exceeds the age of 500 years old, then they are considered a Longbeard and may roll on the Heirlooms Table twice and the Bonus XP Table. If the age is anything younger, then the player gains no additional XP, nor can they roll on the Heirlooms Table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Longbeard Status</h3>\n<p>Longbeards hold a special status within Dwarfen society and are highly respected by other Dwarfs. Female Dwarfs can still be considered Longbeards based on the length of their hair instead of a beard. A Longbeard&rsquo;s Status is considered one Tier higher when speaking with younger Dwarfs and cannot be defied in Dwarf society. If the Longbeard is already of Gold Tier Status, then their Gold Status Rank is doubled within the presence of other Dwarfs.

Naturally, wealth brought raiding armies of Ogres and greenskins, but behind shieldwalls of rune-imbued gold, Clan Barruk proved impossible to break, and no foe could shift the stout Dwarfs from their mountaintop home. Only when the last lode was excavated and their mine fully depleted did Clan Barruk abandon it, marching out in search of new riches. Thus, while a new source of wealth is sought, the Goldshields have seen duty fighting alongside many other holds, eager to establish their clan&rsquo;s good name and hoping to dampen the disparaging remarks about their being &lsquo;new money&rsquo;.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.IT3s7rmQFGNzIfYq]{Shieldsman} Talent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Clan Drakebeard</strong></h3>\n<p>The most famous clan of Karak Kadrin, and indeed one of the most well known in all of the Karaz Ankor, is the Drakebeard Clan. The most noble of its line is none other than Ungrim Ironfist, King of Karak Kadrin. As Ungrim&rsquo;s only son, Garagrim, was slain, Ungrim is now without a direct heir &mdash; a fact not lost on the rest of the noble sons of the Drakebeards. The clan thanes each seek to lead throngs to glory and thus catch the eye of their warrior king. As they are a grudge-ridden folk, even for Dwarfs, and Peak Pass is full of perils, there is no shortage of foes, presenting constant opportunities for the fiery-hearted thanes to prove themselves. Their symbol, the writhing Dragon with Grimnir&rsquo;s seal, appears on their banners, while the deep red of their shields marks them as loyal to Karak Kadrin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.8pVzgPkgWpTJvfhG]{Fearless (Any)} Talent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Yinlinsson Clan</strong></h3>\n<p>Yinlin was a master brewer who, it is said, made lagers and ales so thirst quenching that Valaya herself blessed his good work when she settled at Karaz-a-Karak. Since those days, the clan has remained brewers to that fabled Dwarfhold. In order to deliver their wares to the many outposts surrounding the Everpeak, it takes a well-armed throng - the mountain roads are full of enemies that covet their cargo. Thus, the stylized keg or tankard with the Yinlinsson mark and the rune of Valaya is oft seen on the shields and banners marching to and from the greatest city of the Dwarfs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.hTgrGkWnmIR4xhVe]{Carouser} Talent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>The Norgrimlings</strong></h3>\n<p>All Dwarfs reserve a special loathing for Skaven, but the Norgrimlings have more reason than most. A mining clan out of Karak Eight Peaks, it was not unusual for a Norgrimling to go decades or longer without seeing the sun. Based in the lower levels, it was their kin that suffered the brunt of the ratmen&rsquo;s invasion during their long siege of Karak Eight Peaks. The atrocities perpetrated by the Skaven when they finally broke into the deeps is part of a saga passed down by the survivors, told as a &lsquo;coming of age&rsquo; tale to their young warriors. Now, scattered across many holds, some Norgrimlings still toil in the deep mines, but most seek to one day fight as Ironbreakers or Irondrakes. Although the clan was scattered for long ages, many have now gathered beneath the banner of King Belegar.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.E98mVLZgE8bX5vQW]{Hatred (Skavens)} Talent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Cragbrow Clan</strong></h3>\n<p>A distinct branch of the fabled Engineers Guild, the Cragbrow were amongst the first to found the hold of Barak Varr. Inventors from their clan are credited with creating the first steampowered vessels ever built &mdash; the many varieties of ironclad warships and submersible craft with which the Dwarfs ply the seas. Known for their eccentric behavior, penchant for grog and their prolific use of salty curses, the Cragbrow are amongst the few of their race to use nautical devices as part of their clan symbol. Not surprisingly, they have established close ties with Zhufbar and are regarded as unorthodox and a bit suspicious by most other Dwarfs - for they are a well-travelled folk and also willingly take to sea or the air.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You gain the @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.Ij9N3G8jzxb4lrwy]{Sea Legs} or @Compendium[wfrp4e-core.talents.L74MT9BDwE4CfutY]{Old Salt} Talent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Clan Angrund</strong></h3>\n<p>And so, it has gone at Karak Eight Peaks for decades; Belegar and his Dwarfs withstanding plots, alliances, ambushes, super-weapons, and untold deathtraps. Three times they have been rescued by relief forces that broke through the cordon of foes to bring much-needed reinforcements, the last army led by Thorgrim himself. Belegar has sworn a mighty oath to retake Karak Eight Peaks and, inch by bloody inch, the Dwarfs have expanded their foothold. With each small gain, the engineers refortify before the inevitable counterattack arrives.

In the olden days we wouldn't have gone above for more than an hour unless we had to. All that sun and air's bad for your health you know, and there's plenty of Ranger gone missing never to return. Course, some say they got sun-touched and wandered off, others think the Trolls and Orcs got them. Who am I to say?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Durgrim Redmane, Hammerer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rangers are the long-ranged eyes and ears of most Dwarf settlements. They patrol far from the safety of the hold, often spending long periods out in the wilderness, keeping watch on the Dwarfs&rsquo; many enemies and tracking dangerous beasts.</p>\n<p>It is the Rangers who explore hidden valleys, push through collapsed sections of the Underway and scale the cliffsides in search of new pathways. Rangers will hunt down and dispose of lone monsters or ambush small mobs of Goblins, but when they confront larger creatures or enemy armies on the march, the Rangers send signals to the nearest outposts to alert them of the encroaching danger.</p>\n<p>While all holds are thankful for such services, that doesn&rsquo;t mean the Rangers are well respected. Rangers are a wandering lot &mdash; often moving between holds. After months surviving in the wilderness, far off the beaten track, they are, at best, weather-beaten and travel worn. Most consider them to be outcast clans, desperate to earn their way back into a hold. Sometimes this is the case, but just as often, the Rangers turn out to be an independent-minded breed of Dwarf, small groups from respectable clans that feel more at home on the mountainsides. Unlike most of their kin, they camp under the stars, moving from rough camp to camp. With such free spirits, it is no wonder that so many Dwarfs are mistrustful of Rangers, generally believing them to be a bit unhealthy from breathing so much open air and exposing themselves so often to the sun.</p>\n<p>To survive on the harsh mountain slopes without the security of a nearby hold to fall back to, Rangers have learned to be stealthy and to fight in a manner unique for Dwarfs. They are ambush-hunters, experts at approaching the enemy from unexpected angles. Where possible, they will trigger avalanches, misdirect wayward foes over cliffs, or lead them into the teeth of an oncoming ice storm. Rangers are walking arsenals and carry a slew of different weapons &mdash; crossbows to skewer foes at long range, throwing axes for close ranged slaying while on the move, an axe for close combat and, for truly imposing foes, great axes. They have learned to keep bedrolls, pots, pans, and climbing gear secreted in camps hidden along their mountainous routes, yet still, they must carry all their provisions on their backs as well.</p>\n<p>Many times, a Ranger&rsquo;s greatest deeds go unwitnessed &mdash; acts of sabotage such as rolling gunpowder barrels downhill onto enemy camps, spiking the foe&rsquo;s water supplies with intoxicating agents, or leading the wild beasts that haunt the mountain passes onto the enemy trail, allowing wild Manticores or hungry Wyverns to do some of their work for them. Rangers are mysterious figures, and it is not surprising that many tales are told of their deeds. The most famous of their kind is the regiment known as Bugman&rsquo;s Rangers &mdash; vengeance-seekers who follow their brewmaster, turning up out of the wilds with grim tidings before lending a hand in the battle that is sure to follow.&rdquo;<strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Dwarf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Ranger</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Forest Ranger Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;

Not as dangerous as it used to be, mind, but then that's why our ancestors formed the Ironbreakers. Head to foot in the best gromril armour, it'd be a brave Goblin, Troll or ratman who faces an Ironbreaker and doesn't turn tail. And even if the roof caved in, not that a good proper Dwarf roof would do that, but them Goblin tunnels is shoddy work, nine times out of ten he'd climb out again, dust himself down and get back to the fight, not like you young whelps...&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Durgrim Redmane, Hammerer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dwarf Ironbreakers are amongst the most heavily armored warriors fielded by the armies of the Dwarfs. Clad from head to toe with full suits of magnificent Gromril armor and Rune weapons, these warriors are considered by many to be the elite of the elite. Many Dwarf strongholds have deep tunnels which the Dwarfs have long since abandoned. These tunnels have become home to all kinds of monsters such as Night Goblins, Skaven, Trolls and even more sinister horrors.</p>\n<p>All manner of fell creatures lurk below and the Ironbreakers guard the deep abandoned tunnels from those that would otherwise invade the hold. They spend much of their time below ground in the deepest, least visited parts of the stronghold. In these dark places, ambush and rockfall are commonplace hazards and survival is often dependent on wearing the right armor. Accordingly, Ironbreakers wear fine suits of gromril armor, crafted by the smiths of the hold and worn as a badge of honor by this select band of warriors.</p>\n<p>To serve as an Ironbreaker, a Dwarf must take vows to stand bold, even if no king, Lord or Thane is near. Behind and above him are the beardlings, treasure troves, ancestral tombs, and the very halls that the forefathers of his race carved out of rock in ages past. Before and below an Ironbreaker will be only the dark, the all-consuming blackness that hungers to grasp everything into its clutches.</p>\n<p>Ironbreakers are trained to fight in tight formations, wedged into the confines of narrow tunnels. There, they find defensible positions and let the enemy break upon their overlapping shields as waves crash into rock. Impervious, implacable and unmoving, they form a living line, gromril-hard, that holds back the flood of terror that lurks in the dark below. Enemies fall before their axes like winter wheat before the scythe and blows clang harmlessly off their nigh-impervious armor or are caught and deflected by their sturdy shields. Each regiment of Ironbreakers will have a veteran, a grizzled unit leader known as an Ironbeard, who knows the undertunnels like the back of his hand. It is an Ironbeard&rsquo;s duty to maneuver the unit into a favorable position and to call out the battle formations, such as the box of iron, the steel square, and so on.</p>\n<p>Such is the reputation of the Ironbreakers that they will often be called upon to fight on the surface when the full might of a throng is mustered, but for each battle in sunlight, an Ironbreaker will have fought a dozen in the dark deeps beneath the mountains. Some Ironbreakers can carry cinderblast bombs - small grenades thrown by hand, whose shrapnel is especially deadly in close confines.&rdquo;<strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Dwarf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ironbreaker Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;

They will then spend several hours servicing their armor and weapons, as is the dwarf way, sharpening blades to razor-fine edges and polishing armor to a dull shine. The rest of the day is typically spent patrolling and training with their weapons. If they are garrisoned near the clan&rsquo;s hold they will spend hours marching the tunnels, hunting any goblins, orcs or skaven foolish enough to venture up from the depths. Periodically they will rest and spend an hour or so drilling, the clash of arms echoing up and down the tunnels. Finally, they will return to their camp and finish the day doing what dwarfs do best &ndash; drinking!</p>\n<p>A shieldbreaker&rsquo;s first and last duty is to their clan. Whether they have taken up the title for honor or gold (something equally interchangeable for Dwarfs) they are expected to put no power, lord, or god before their oath to the clan. Even when a shieldbreaker is far from his clan&rsquo;s holdings he is expected to always conduct himself with honor and courage, mindful that he represents not only himself, but the clan wherever he travels.</p>\n<p>A close second to a Shieldbreaker&rsquo;s duty to the clan is his duty to the dwarf race. He is expected to constantly fight against the foes of the dwarf wherever they are found. As dwarfs are slow to forgive and have long memories, their enemies can be found almost anywhere.</p>\n<p>While most shieldbreakers are dwarfs, there are rare instances when a member of another race will take up arms and oaths for the dwarfs. Humans have been known to become shieldbreakers, usually those who live close to dwarf holds or have befriended a dwarf.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when a human fights side by side with dwarfs and impresses the doughty warriors with his prowess, he will be invited to serve the clan. However, such a life is far from easy for a non-dwarf, and they must constantly struggle to prove themselves with feats of daring and courage in combat and strength and endurance otherwise.</p>\n<p>In fact, the first test of a non-dwarf shieldbreaker is usually to be taken deep underground, without light or food, and forced to find their way back to the surface. It is an easy task for most dwarfs but can be fatal for softer races.&rdquo;<strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species: </strong>Human, Dwarf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Shieldbreaker Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;

There ain't no shortcuts, only quick deaths.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&mdash;Durgrim Redmane, on how to become a Hammerer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dwarf Hammerers forms a Dwarf King's personal bodyguard, chosen by the King himself. They are individuals from different units, and perhaps even clans, who have proven themselves in uncountable battles, showing not just great strength and deadly martial prowess, but also steadfast loyalty and a bold and courageous nature. They are formed into a hard-hitting shock unit, a force capable of breaking enemy formations the way a heavy warhammer crushes shale.</p>\n<p>In addition to being a formidable fighting unit, the Hammerers are often used as a Thane or Lord&rsquo;s personal bodyguard. Duty to a liege is a sacred thing to Dwarfs. An individual bound by oath to his Lord will fight all the harder, and for the leader of the throng, a Hammerer will gladly give his life rather than face the dishonor of failure. A king surrounded by his Hammerers is the keep in the center of the throng: grim and unyielding, a living personification of the indomitable Dwarf spirit. Of course, the allegiance goes both ways, and it is a Lord&rsquo;s duty to properly equip these hand-picked units and to seal the oath between them.</p>\n<p>The symbol of the bond between a Lord and his Hammerers is the weapons they carry. Each is given a heavy, but perfectly balanced, great hammer, which is often made of gromril. Outfitted in heavy, well-polished Dwarf mail, Hammerers wade into combat wielding their great weapons. They swing their hammers in sweeping arcs, hitting their enemies with such vigor that only enchanted or hell-forged armor can withstand the force of their blows. With a cracking and crumpling, the whirling hammerheads send up gory debris, as splintered shields, cracked bits of armor and even heads or limbs are thrown into the air by the sheer force of the impact. Dwarf battle lines have been known to cheer at the sight of the great hammers rising and falling around their king&rsquo;s banner, beating out a rhythmic noise that is not unlike the deep-booming industrial sounds made by the vast drop hammers found in the larger Dwarf forges.</p>\n<p>As the most elite warriors, Hammerers enjoy a high status within their hold. When not personally shielding their Thane or king, they are tasked with guarding key elements, such as the throne room or front gate. Larger strongholds will have many regiments of Hammerers, and these often become known by the name of what or whom they guard, such as the Peak Gate Guard of Karak Norn or the Drakebeard Guard, the Hammerers assigned to guard Thane Ull Hammerhand of the Drakebeard clan in Karak Kadrin.&rdquo;<strong>&mdash;Warhammer Wiki</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Species:&nbsp;</strong>Dwarf</p>\n<p><strong>Class:&nbsp;</strong>Warrior</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Hammerer Advance Scheme</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0712%;
